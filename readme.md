# Less.sugar #

An Espresso sugar for Less.
Apart from applying colour to the code, the navigator works properly (with nested selectors as well). Furthermore there is autocomplete for the Bootstrap Less mixins.

## Issues ##

* There are some other issues with overly strict spacing/newline behaviour
* Colours are not optimised to nicely fit
* Properties passed in mixin calls do not get proper colouring
